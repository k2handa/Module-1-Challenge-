# Kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

 * The purpose of this analysis was to determine and visualize the successes, failures and cancelations of various sets of data. particularly in this assignment 
 * it surrounded theathres and date they were launched, and monetary goals for plays 


## Analysis and Challenges

 * to perform the anlysis, various tools had to be implemented to the data. first implementing formulas to better clean up the original data set. 
 * for this I used the following fomrulas
	   - = Year()
	   - = Countifs()
	   - = sum()
 * as well as necessary Pivot tables and Charts to organize and present my data


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	* Here we can see that the greatest number of successes for Theatre creations was in the Month of May at 111
	* this also coincides with the greatest number of failures which was also in May at 52
	* looking at this data we can conclude that the month of May seems to have the highest output of theatres as it coincides with the busy summer movie season
	* below we can see the chart image

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	* Here we are checking the success and failure rate based on Goals, for plays 
	* based on the data we see that as the goal amount increases, failures over takes the successful as it approaches 50,000
	* below we can see the graph showing this trend

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	* potential issues that may arise would be formula errors, since they are very sensitive, or wrong cell references that will change the outlook of your data when creating the charts or pivots


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1) based on the launch date, May is the most successful and highest failures for theatres
	2) both success and failure seems to diverge in the month of December 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	* the outcomes based on goals shows that as the goals amount increases the number of failures over takes the number of sucesses for plays. 
	* the lower the goal amount the more successes are seen. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	* the data doesn't show regions, i think this would be important in terms of figuring out theatre outcomes as well as plays goal amounts. different regions and cities have an affinity to plays and theatres, NYC has a huge and expensive broadway following. 



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	* we can also look at the Parent Company outcomes based on Launch date and Goals, this will give us a different look as well to the data. or even based on specific years, instead of the months
